# Contribution Policy 

## Open Source Contributions

In order to make contributions to any open source project as an employee of Indeed, we need you to do 4 things:

1. Read through this document
1. Check in with your manager
1. Tell us about your work
1. Contribute responsibly

## 1. What This Document Says

This document describes contributions which are pre-authorized, the process for authorizing other contributions, and some of the easiest ways to get yourself into trouble when contributing code to an open source project.
*If you have questions not addressed in this document, reach out to your Director of Open Source.* 

## 2. Check In With Your Manager
Before planning any open source contributions, you should check in with your manager to make sure you’re aligned on both the time investment and the scope of the contribution.

## 3. Tell Us About Your Work

If you are going to participate in the development of open source software, we ask that you let us know by registering your GitHub ID <link redacted>, and if you do other open source work outside of GitHub. We’ll make your public GitHub activity available in your Individual Contributor Dashboard, so that you can easily reference it during the review process.

## 4. Contributing Responsibly

We ask that employees use good judgment when participating in open source communities. Remember that you are acting as a representative of Indeed in all interactions!
Generally speaking, you should never need to ask if you want to contribute bug fixes, tests, design work, accessibility updates, or general code improvements. If you want to contribute larger work, features, or other major functionality, we ask that you use good judgement.
There are three easy ways to get yourself into trouble when participating in an open source community as part of your work at Indeed: giving away Indeed’s core IP, donating code that contains Indeed’s proprietary information, and signing a legal agreement without authority.

### Don’t Contribute Core IP Without Checking
We have identified the following areas that contain Core IP for Indeed:
* Search Quality (including relevance and ranking)
* Job Aggregation
* Search Recommendation 

If you have code that you’ve written for Indeed that falls into any of these areas, you must get approval from an Engineering Director or VP before planning the contribution. If you ever have a doubt about your contribution, open a ticket and we’ll help you.

### Conduct A Peer Review

Before you make your contribution, sit down with a peer at Indeed and do a code review. Be sure your contribution is good quality, and free from any Indeed-specific references, proprietary information, and PII. If you need additional help, file a ticket in the "OSS" JIRA project, and we can review it for you

### Ask For Help When Presented With A Legal Document.

Does the project ask you to sign or agree to anything? This could be a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), or something else. If the project asks you, as an employee of Indeed, to sign anything, or click through any agreement, you want to check in with us before doing so. Unlike open source software licenses, there is no commonly established language that goes into a CLA or a DCO, and so it’s important to have these evaluated by the legal department before you sign them. Open a ticket in the "OSS" JIRA project, and we review the agreement with Legal.

CLAs come in two flavors - Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) and Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA). The ICLA covers contributions you make as an individual, while the CCLA covers contributions you make as an employee of Indeed. The best way to be sure your contributions are appropriately cleared is to sign both CLAs. Indeed has signed a number of CCLAs already (Corporate Contributor License Agreements).  If you wish to contribute to one of these projects, let us know and we can add you to the CCLA.

#### Unfamiliar Licenses

If the license for the projects does not appear in the OSI-Approved License list, you should open a ticket and ask us for help. 
 
#### Using (as opposed to contributing to) Open Source

Indeed also allows and encourages Open Source Software (OSS) to be used as part of software development. However, using OSS can come with certain risks (including potentially having to release source code!) and so care must be taken to ensure that your use aligns with company policy.
Before using OSS in software development, please make sure you have read and are complying with the Indeed OSS Usage Acknowledgement.
