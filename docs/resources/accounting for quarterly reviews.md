# Accounting For Open Source Contributions During Quarterly Reviews

## Open Source Participation Can Happen In Any Role, At Any Level

There are many ways to participate in open source. Some examples are shown below. There should never be an expectation of open source participation that is based on an individual’s level or experience, and open source participation does not itself inform the level at which someone is working.

However, there are some kinds of participation that demonstrate advanced skills or knowledge, and these kinds of participation can be used to help determine the level at which someone is working. Some examples follow.



Type of Participation| Junior| Mid | Senior| Lead| Principal

Bug Fixes | Y| Y | Y | Y | Y

## General Advice
Here are some general pointers to help keep the review conversations on track.

### Focus On Evaluating The Individual. 
The question of “Was Open Source The Right Choice In This Circumstance?” is a question that is outside the scope of the quarterly review. Try to keep the focus on the quality of work that has been presented.

### Calibrate Against Non-Open Source Activities. 

The examples above are not canonical. If you see behaviors listed that you evaluate differently within your organization, you should calibrate accordingly. If an individual is driving process improvements for an open source project that Indeed depends on, this demonstrates the same behavior and relies on the same skills required to drive process improvements for the team.
